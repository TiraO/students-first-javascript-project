#To-Do

1. ~~Fix velocity by adding frametime~~
2. Make the snowflake rotate as it falls
3. Make the snowflake shimmy as it falls
4. ~~Delay the fall until user provides input~~
5. ~~Let user create more snowflakes~~
6. ~~Loop snowflake falling~~
7. ~~make a finished snowflake be one object~~
8. ~~Deploy it online~~
9. should velocity really be based on screen height?
10. don't draw an extra line when you're finishing the snowflake?
11. basic instructions on screen (in progress)

15. turn into a pile of snow
