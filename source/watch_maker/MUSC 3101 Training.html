        <p> You have reached the end of the training phase of MUSC 3101. To advance to the next phase (the Americas and
            Caribbean), find your way to the "Training Complete" screen of this choose-your-own-adventure activity. Once
            there, take a screenshot and upload it to Blackboard. Like many choose-your-own-adventure stories, this one has
            dead ends. If you reach one, refresh the page to start again. </p>
        <button onclick="alert('Refresh to start again')">What happens if I reach a different end screen?'</button>
        <button onclick="alert('Review the Mission Briefing, the #questions channel on Slack, etc. Also ask your teammates for assistance - you can work together.')">
